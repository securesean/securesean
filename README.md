Hi, I’m Sean Pierce - a Senior Offensive Engineer with over a decade of experience in red teaming, threat emulation, and security research. I design and lead campaigns to improve security posture by developing novel attack tools, techniques, and processes. My background includes leading adversary emulation exercises at Microsoft, Target, Mandiant, and lecturing on malware and information security at multiple Universities.

I’m passionate about sharing knowledge and building the security community. I’ve spoken at Defcon, Blackhat, and other conferences, contributed tools and code on GitHub, and have developed free courseware for malware reverse engineering. My technical skills span Windows internals, POSIX OS’s, offensive toolsets like Cobalt Strike and Empire, and programming in C/C++, C#, Python, PowerShell, .NET, Java, JScript, PHP, and assembly.

I hold an MS in Cyber Security from NYU, a BS in Computer Engineering from UTA, and certifications including CISSP and GIAC CFEC. I love collaborating on open-source projects, reverse engineering, and building tools that help defenders and attackers alike sharpen their skills.

Let’s connect and build something awesome!
